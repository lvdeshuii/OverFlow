**Background**

In July 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology collectively released a directive to accelerate the widespread adoption and application of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). The directive specifically targets **"advancing the IPv6 upgrade within financial institutions, continuously enhancing the IPv6 support capabilities of internet-facing financial service applications, and strengthening the IPv6 monitoring and maintenance framework."** This initiative is identified as a critical step towards the broad deployment and use of IPv6.

**Overview**

One bank took this initiative seriously, dedicating efforts to fulfill the IPv6 upgrade mandate. By early 2022, it had developed a network infrastructure that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (a dual-stack network), enhancing IPv6 compatibility across various customer-facing applications like its website, online and mobile banking, and WeChat banking services. To boost the operational effectiveness of this dual-stack network and fortify its maintenance structure, the bank adopted Netis NPM, a cutting-edge, comprehensive traffic analysis system. This system is designed to perform real-time monitoring of internet traffic across critical network segments and applications.

**Value of the Case**

- **Network Traffic Visualization**: Offers a fast and intuitive view of the network's topology and details, setting the stage for uncovering the network's internal business potential.
- **Service Path Mapping from a Business Perspective**: Moves beyond the isolated worlds of traditional network and application maintenance;
- **Comparative View of Internet Applications in IPv4 and IPv6**: Stay informed about the usage, performance metrics of IPv4 versus IPv6 applications, enabling dynamic adjustment of network resources to swiftly meet application needs;
- **Accurate Network Anomaly Detection and Quick Alerts**: Reduces time to resolve issues, enhancing network service quality.

**1. Netis NPM: A Comprehensive Network Traffic Management Platform**

Built on proven network mirroring technology, the full-traffic network analysis system duplicates network traffic in real-time to a Traffic Analysis Probe (TAP). This TAP then aggregates, tags, and distributes traffic to various analysis probes based on predefined rules. These probes dissect and process the traffic, after which an all-in-one management platform consolidates and presents the findings.

Through comprehensive traffic analysis on internet exit pathways and the networking hardware surrounding security mechanisms, it crafts distinct, visual perspectives for both IPv4 and IPv6. This allows for real-time monitoring of network health, enabling IT staff to swiftly grasp daily network operations.

**2. The Innovative SPV: Network Insights Through the Application Lens**

Normally, network and application management are siloed into separate teams, leading to a fragmented response when issues arise, which slows down troubleshooting and problem-solving. Netis NPM breaks new ground with its Service Path View (SPV) technology. By creating a comprehensive, end-to-end monitoring framework centered around the business's perspective, it shifts the focus onto how applications interact with the network. The SPV illuminates an application's network condition across four key areas: traffic volume, network performance, application performance, and availability. This empowers IT teams to quickly pinpoint and resolve any issues as soon as they arise, ensuring smooth application operation.

**3. Everything at a Glance: IPv4 vs. IPv6 Network Metrics Comparison**

At the gateway to the internet, one bank has leveraged the professional capabilities of Netis NPM to create a large display that contrasts the network performance of IPv4 and IPv6. This setup allows for real-time monitoring of the exit paths to the internet, significantly boosting user satisfaction by ensuring smooth connectivity.
