In the evolution of trading systems, traders have consistently sought speed. With the growing popularity of quantitative trading, the demand for lightning-fast systems has only increased.

### Challenges in Monitoring High-Frequency Trading Systems

The advent of high-frequency trading systems has significantly increased the complexity of application operations and maintenance management, demanding unprecedented accuracy, performance, and stability from monitoring tools.

- Nanosecond-level monitoring precision required: High-frequency trading necessitates the rapid processing of orders and low-latency market feedback, with transaction processing speeds typically in the microsecond range. Traditional monitoring tools fall short of achieving microsecond or even nanosecond precision, unable to keep up with the high-speed demands of high-frequency trading systems.
- Need for specialized protocol decoding: Traditional monitoring tools lack the comprehensive decoding capabilities needed to fully support the automatic decoding of mainstream high-frequency trading systems.
- Minimizing impact on system performance: Traditional tools that log or insert code consume significant system resources, compromising stability and failing to offer precise monitoring of high-frequency trading systems.

Thus, application operation and maintenance teams require monitoring tools that are high in precision and performance, with robust decoding capabilities. Such tools can outpace high-frequency trading itself, tackling issues like difficult troubleshooting, pinpointing problems, and complex analysis to ensure the seamless operation of high-frequency trading systems.

### BPC High-Frequency Trading Edition

For years, Netis BPC has been pivotal in ensuring operational continuity for clients in the securities sector. By capturing network traffic via bypass deployment, Netis BPC delivers essential features like four key indicators, intelligent alerts, individual transaction tracking, and multi-dimensional statistical analysis. The upgraded "BPC High-Frequency Trading Edition" introduces nanosecond-level monitoring, offering comprehensive maintenance support for high-frequency trading systems.

**Nanosecond Timestamp Technology**

The core challenge for high-frequency trading systems lies in managing penetration, uplink, and full-path latencies, mostly measured in microseconds. This necessitates monitoring solutions capable of nanosecond precision. The "BPC High-Frequency Trading Edition" elevates precision from microseconds to nanoseconds, allowing for the swift calculation of time spent on each trading segment and across the entire chain. With accurate latency measurements, it immediately alerts users to any significant order delays, pinpointing issues with features like latency-thruput correlation and one-click tracking.

**A Business-Centric Monitoring Approach**

"BPC High-Frequency Trading Edition" intelligently maps out the logical relationships between systems following actual business processes, offering a service-oriented perspective. It uses service path diagrams for real-time monitoring of core middleware and exchange components, providing essential metrics such as volume, response times, rates, and success rates, enabling quick issue resolution.
